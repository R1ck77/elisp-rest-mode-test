## Emacs lisp rest-mode ##

A simple test/prototype to understand the tools for the implementation of a dired-like mode.

Seeing me converge slowly to a semi-decent dired implementation is unlikely to be of interest to anyone, so no matter what you are looking for _you are probably in the wrong place_.

This is the (rather excellent) service I'm using as a data-set: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

## Status ##

A couple of semi-generic functions are in place that allow to show a list of entries (no paging supported yet) and a detail page (in split screen) with minimum boilerplate code.

A reasonably motivated developer with a bit of emacs knowledge (and a very high tolerance for long names, lack of namespaces be damned!)  should be able to integrate another service with little effort.
